  "synopsis": "The second edition of MODERN GARDE MANGER: A GLOBAL PERSPECTIVE, was written for both the working chef and the serious student engaged in the practice and study of culinary arts. The first edition was winner of the International Association of Culinary Professionals (IACP) Cookbook Award. Its carefully researched information and fully tested recipes span the international spectrum of the modern garde manger station. Four sections covering twenty chapters focus on the chef's required knowledge and responsibilities. This second edition has been reorganized to provide a clearer transition from subject to subject, and skill set to skill set. Special features include: Chapter Goals; Professional Profiles; Ask the Expert; People, Places, Things; Review Questions; Activities and Applications; and Key Words in Review. The text contains material on molecular cuisine, plus creative equipment used by garde manger chefs. There are more than 800 four-color photographs of which more than 300 are new, including many finished plates, platters, showpieces and step-by-step procedures, plus many additional recipes and expanded content on food show competition, buffet table layouts, ice sculpting techniques and more. . While Modern Garde Manger, 2e still retains its exposure to international recipes and techniques, more traditionally American recipes and techniques have been included in this edition. MODERN GARDE MANGER 2E is the most comprehensive book of its kind available for today's student and professional chef. In addition, a CourseMate website is available to accompany the text. CourseMate includes: an interactive eBook; Engagement Tracker, a first-of-its-kind tool that monitors student engagement in the course; and interactive teaching and learning tools including quizzes, flashcards, crossword puzzles, PowerPoint slides and more.<br><b>Important Notice: Media content referenced within the product description or the product text may not be available in the ebook version. </b></br>",
